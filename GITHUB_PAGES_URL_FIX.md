# GitHub Pages URL Fix - Issue Resolution

## Problem Identified
The GitHub Pages URLs being generated and saved to Airtable were returning **404 Not Found** errors when clicked.

## Root Cause
The URL generation code was creating URLs without the `reports/` directory prefix:
```
❌ INCORRECT: https://jtbrown21.github.io/AI_Monthly_Reporting_Reports/filename.html
✅ CORRECT:   https://jtbrown21.github.io/AI_Monthly_Reporting_Reports/reports/filename.html
```

## Investigation Results
1. **Files were published correctly** - All HTML files were successfully uploaded to the `reports/` directory in GitHub
2. **GitHub Pages was enabled** - The service was working properly
3. **URLs were malformed** - Missing the `reports/` prefix in the generated URLs

## Fix Applied
Updated the URL generation code in `scripts/report_generator.py` line 456:

### Before:
```python
github_url = f"https://{self.github_repo.split('/')[0]}.github.io/{repo_name}/{filename}"
```

### After:
```python
github_url = f"https://{self.github_repo.split('/')[0]}.github.io/{repo_name}/reports/{filename}"
```

## Testing Results
✅ **URL Generation**: Now creates correct URLs with `/reports/` prefix
✅ **URL Accessibility**: All generated URLs return HTTP 200 status
✅ **Airtable Updates**: URLs are correctly saved to Airtable records
✅ **GitHub Pages**: Files are accessible via the correct GitHub Pages URLs

## URLs Now Working
- Original test: https://jtbrown21.github.io/AI_Monthly_Reporting_Reports/reports/Abby-Spachman-2025-07-10.html
- Latest test: https://jtbrown21.github.io/AI_Monthly_Reporting_Reports/reports/Abby-Spachman-2025-07-15.html

## Status
✅ **RESOLVED** - The 404 error issue has been completely fixed. All future report URLs will be generated correctly and will be accessible via GitHub Pages.

## Production Impact
- **Existing reports**: May need URLs updated if they were generated with the old format
- **New reports**: Will automatically generate correct URLs
- **Airtable records**: Will be updated with working URLs for all new reports
