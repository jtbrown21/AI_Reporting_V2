# 🔧 Patch Notes: Headshot Persistence Fix

**Release Date:** July 17, 2025  
**Version:** 2.1.0  
**Priority:** High - Bug Fix

## 🐛 Issue Resolved

### Problem
Client headshots were disappearing from reports after 24 hours, leaving broken image placeholders. When reports were first generated, headshots displayed correctly, but returning to the same report URL later showed missing images.

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Temporary URLs**: Reports were using Airtable attachment URLs that expire after ~24 hours
2. **Storage Issues**: Images were being stored as base64 text instead of binary data
3. **MIME Type Problems**: GitHub's raw URLs weren't serving proper image content types

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### New Permanent Headshot System
- **One-time Download**: System now downloads headshots from Airtable once and stores them permanently
- **GitHub Integration**: Images are stored in the repository under `assets/headshots/` 
- **Smart Caching**: Existing headshots are reused to prevent duplicate downloads
- **Permanent URLs**: Reports now use GitHub Pages URLs that never expire

### Technical Improvements
- **Direct GitHub API**: Implemented direct GitHub REST API calls for proper binary file handling
- **Proper Encoding**: Fixed base64 encoding/decoding for binary content storage
- **MIME Type Fix**: GitHub Pages now serves images with correct `image/jpeg` content type
- **Safe Filenames**: Client names are sanitized for safe file storage (e.g., "John Doe & Associates" → "john-doe-associates-headshot.jpg")

### URL Structure Change
```
Before: https://dl.airtable.com/.../expiring-url
After:  https://app.agentinsider.co/assets/headshots/client-name-headshot.jpg
```

## 🚀 Benefits

### For Users
- **Permanent Access**: Headshots will never disappear from reports
- **Consistent Experience**: Images display reliably across all devices and browsers
- **Historical Reports**: Old reports will continue working with stored headshots

### For System
- **Reduced API Calls**: No repeated downloads for existing headshots
- **Better Performance**: Faster image loading from CDN
- **Improved Reliability**: No dependency on Airtable's temporary URLs

## 📋 Implementation Details

### New Methods Added
- `_download_and_store_headshot()`: Downloads and permanently stores client headshots
- Enhanced `format_value()`: Handles headshot processing with client context
- GitHub API integration: Direct file upload with proper binary handling

### File Structure
```
assets/
└── headshots/
    ├── greg-aldridge-headshot.jpg
    ├── john-doe-headshot.jpg
    └── jane-smith-headshot.jpg
```

### Error Handling
- **Network Failures**: 30-second timeout with graceful fallback
- **Missing Headshots**: Returns empty string for records without images
- **Invalid Filenames**: Automatic sanitization of client names
- **GitHub API Errors**: Comprehensive error logging and fallback

## 🧪 Testing Results

### Before Fix
```bash
# Temporary URL (expires)
https://dl.airtable.com/.../attachment.jpg

# Content served as base64 text
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
```

### After Fix
```bash
# Permanent URL (never expires)
https://app.agentinsider.co/assets/headshots/greg-aldridge-headshot.jpg

# Content served as proper image
Content-Type: image/jpeg
File recognition: RIFF (little-endian) data, Web/P image
```

## 📝 Migration Notes

### For Existing Reports
- **Automatic**: No manual intervention required
- **Gradual**: Headshots will be downloaded and stored when reports are regenerated
- **Backward Compatible**: System gracefully handles reports without headshots

### For New Reports
- **Immediate**: All new reports will use permanent headshot URLs
- **Smart Detection**: Only downloads headshots for records that have them
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Skips download if headshot already exists

## 🔍 Monitoring

### Success Indicators
- ✅ Console logs show "Successfully stored headshot for [Client Name]"
- ✅ Images display correctly in reports immediately after generation
- ✅ Images remain accessible after 24+ hours
- ✅ GitHub repository contains files in `assets/headshots/` folder

### Troubleshooting
If headshots still don't appear:
1. Check GitHub repository for stored files
2. Verify GitHub Pages deployment status
3. Ensure proper environment variables are set
4. Check console logs for error messages

## 🏁 Conclusion

This fix completely resolves the headshot disappearing issue by implementing a robust permanent storage system. Client headshots will now persist indefinitely, ensuring consistent report presentation and improved user experience.

**Impact:** High - Resolves critical user experience issue  
**Complexity:** Medium - Requires GitHub API integration  
**Risk:** Low - Backward compatible with existing reports
